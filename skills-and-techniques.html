<h1>Skills and techniques</h1>
    <main>
    <h2>Marketing and communication design</h2>
    <p>Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. 
      This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the 
      trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, 
      meaning, for example, that (B2B) business-to-business website design considerations might differ 
      greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website. Careful 
      consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not 
      clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web navigation,[9] especially 
      on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site 
      is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.</p>

      <h2>User experience design and interactive design</h2>
    <p>User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how 
      the website works. This is part of the user experience design. User experience is related to 
      layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can 
      interact on a site may also depend on the interactive design of the site. If a user perceives the 
      usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well 
      versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less user-friendly website 
      interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages 
      or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user 
      experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill.[10] 
      Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the user interface design.

    <p>Advanced interactive functions may require plug-ins if not advanced coding language skills. 
      Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in 
      user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a 
      risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to 
      access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too 
      costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function 
      will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be 
      incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that 
      doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. 
      It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.</p>

    <h2>Page layout</h2>
    <p>Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the page layout. For example, 
      a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different 
      pages when designing the layout. Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning 
      objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same 
      set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen 
      resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for 
      concerns of aesthetics on larger screens.</p>

    <p>Fluid layouts increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based 
      layouts and grid-based design in both page layout design principle and in coding technique, 
      but were very slow to be adopted.[note 1] This was due to considerations of screen reading 
      devices and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design 
      may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, embedded advertising areas, navigation 
      areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the 
      browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of the reader's screen 
      (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the browser can make user-specific layout 
      adjustments to fluid layouts, but not fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often 
      change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below body 
      text rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded 
      grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative 
      position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block 
      unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.</p>

    <p>Responsive Web Design is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device 
      specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS @media rule. In 
      March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.[11]Sites using 
      responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.</p>

      <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few 
      which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles. 
      Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order 
      to avoid complications.</p>

    <p>Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented 
      in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in 
      web typography, as well as the usage of font downloading.</p>

    <p>Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also 
      avoid center-aligned text.[12]</p>

    <h2>Motion graphics</h2>
    <p>The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. 
      The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for 
      the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an 
      entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or 
      formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary 
      and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more 
      serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to 
      the content. In either case, motion graphic design may make the difference between more effective 
      visuals or distracting visuals.</p>

    <p>Motion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. 
      The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable 
      the animations.[13]</p>

    <h2>Quality of code</h2>
    <p>Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually 
      done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may 
      not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of 
      pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes 
      errors in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified 
      properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called tag soup. Validating via W3C[7] 
      can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors 
      in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. 
      This information can then be corrected by the user.[14]</p>

    <h2>Generated content</h2>
      <p>There are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.</p>

    <h3>Static websites</h3>
<!-- Use images from linked site -->
    <p>Main article: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">Static web page</a></i></p>
      <p>A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is 
      requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the 
      website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, 
      similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. 
      These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators 
      such as Jekyll and Adobe Muse.[15]</p>

    <p>The benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed 
      to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration 
      and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost 
      server hardware. These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer 
      dynamic features, and virtual servers offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.</p>

    <p>Almost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and stylesheets
      are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.</p>

      <h3>Dynamic websites</h3>
<!-- Use images from linked site -->
  <p>Main article: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page">Dynamic web page</a></i></p>
    <p>Dynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. 
      They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries 
      across a relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use 
      a document database such as MongoDB or NoSQL to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or 
      wiki articles.</p>

    <p>In the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or wireframed using static pages. The 
      skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving 
      server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic 
      projects are thus almost always a team effort.</p>

    <p>When dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as 
      Perl, PHP or ASP. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side 
      page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page and data was inserted into places 
      defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding 
      language such as Perl.</p>

    <p>Both of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused 
      tools such as content management systems. These build on top of general purpose coding platforms and
      assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well recognised models, such 
      as a time-sequenced blog, a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki or a user forum. These tools make 
      the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organisational and design-based task, 
      without requiring any coding.</p>

    <p>Editing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site 
      itself, and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only 
      to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, 
      anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on 
      forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is Wikipedia.</p>
