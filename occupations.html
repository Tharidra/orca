   <h1>Occupations</h1>
     <main>
    <p>There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, 
      who often work closely together on a website.[30] The web designers are responsible for the visual 
      aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also 
      have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their 
      knowledge will differ from one web designer to another. Particularly in smaller organizations one 
      person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger
      organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.[31]</p>
     
        <p>Further jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Graphic designers to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts and buttons</li>
      <li>Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting 
        viewers to the site, by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet</li>
      <li>SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website and 
        make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines</li>
      <li>Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of the site[1]</li>
      <li>User experience (UX) designer incorporates aspects of user focused design considerations which include 
        information architecture, user centered design, user testing, interaction design, and occasionally 
         visual design.</li>
        </ul>
