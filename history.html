<h1>History</h1>
   <details>
     <summary><h2>1988-2001</h2></summary>
    <main>
   <p>Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. 
      However, web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of 
      people’s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles 
      of typography, background, and music.</p>

   <h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>
   <p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which 
     later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could 
      be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.[2] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic 
      browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and 
      naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or 
      sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[3] The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World 
     Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its 
      interoperability."[4] This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and 
     programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C 
     continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed 
     Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. 
     Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, 
     Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. 
     Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser 
     dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, a
      Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web 
      design evolve at a rapid pace.[5]</p>

    <h3>Evolution of web design</h2>
    <p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features 
      and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an 
      obscure authoring technique.[5] The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying 
      tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating 
      the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and 
      good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was 
      paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even 
      more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use 
      complicated table structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from 
      collapsing.[6] CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. 
      This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved 
      web accessibility, see tableless web design.</p>

    <p>In 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content 
      development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a
      limited precursor to ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the 
      point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web 
      developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. 
      Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) 
      and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target 
      markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used 
      to develop entire sites.[6]</p>

    <h3>End of the first browser wars</h3>
    <p>During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open source licence, 
      enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they 
      decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser
      and soon expanded to a complete application platform.[5] The Web Standards Project was formed 
      and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards by creating Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 
      tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant 
      as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of 
      standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the PNG image format.[5] During 
      this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the 
      browser wars.[5]</p>

    <h2>2001–2012</h2>
    <p>Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. 
      As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant 
      changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.</p>

    <p>Since the end of the browsers wars[when?] new browsers have been released. Many of these are 
      open source meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. 
      The new options are considered by many[weasel words] to be better than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p>

    <p>The W3C has released new standards for HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3), as well as new JavaScript API's, 
      each as a new but individual standard.[when?] While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new 
      version of HTML and some of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire 
      suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).</p>
