      <h1>Homepage design</h1>
        <p>Usability experts, including Jakob Nielsen and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design 
      for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a 
      website.[16][17][18][19] However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a 
      growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content 
      pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds.[20] Leading many practitioners to argue 
      that homepages are less important than most people think.[21][22][23][24] Jared Spool argued in 2007 
      that a site's homepage was actually the least important page on a website.[25]</p>
    
    <p>In 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called 'sliders' and 'rotating banners') have become an extremely 
      popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined 
      space.[26][27] Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a 
      website's search engine optimisation and usability.[27][28][29]</p>
